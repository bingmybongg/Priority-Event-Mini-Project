# 🏆 Priority Event Mini Project

A Java project for the CS2030 assignment. This project simulates a simple shop system where customers are served based on event time using a priority queue. Each event represents an action in the shop (e.g., customer arrival, service completion), and the system ensures that earlier timings are handled first.
